![Image 4: As you get closer to retirement, you'll want to ensure your nest egg lasts as long as you need it.​](https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/media/images/retirement/retirement-planning/sec-3.jpg)

As you get closer to retirement, you'll want to ensure your nest egg lasts as long as you need it. That means figuring out how much you can sustainably spend while continuing to safely grow it to balance out inflation.

If you own assets such as a home, you can also consider unlocking its equity for more retirement income while still retaining ownership. With the right tools and advice, you'll have the financial freedom to live as you wish, without having to compromise your dreams or rely on anyone else.

Make the most of your nest egg

With the possibility of inflation eroding your accumulated nest egg, one way to beat inflation is to stay invested\*. At the same time, you may want to extract a higher stream of retirement income to supplement CPF life payouts for your own lifestyle needs. Investment solutions that offer a decumulation share class could satisfy both requirements. These solutions aim to pay out a high monthly income that is sourced from a combination of portfolio returns as well as the capital of your investment.

To illustrate how this works, let’s take a look at an example: the Schroder Asia More+ fund

What are the key characteristics of this fund?

*   This is an income-oriented, Asian multi-asset fund with modest capital appreciation potential.
*   Designed for the Singapore investor: The fund can invest in Singapore securities and hedges a portion of FX back to SGD.
*   Offers 3 share class options for clients with changing needs at different life stages:  
    **Accumulation** – where all potential coupons, dividends and capital gains are accumulated and re-invested.  
    **Distribution** – Aims to make payouts which are often sourced from a combination of coupons, dividends and capital gains earned by the fund.  
    **Decumulation** – Aims to make higher payouts which may be sourced from a combination of coupons, dividends, capital gain and your investment capital in the fund.

**Check out this video to see how decumulation works**

\*All investments come with risks and you can lose money on your investment. Invest only if you understand and can monitor your investment. Diversify your investments and avoid investing a large portion of your money in a single product issuer.

Unlock cash from your home

While your property slowly grows in value, it can be a source of cash for your retirement.

Borrow against the equity value of your fully-paid property to top-up your CPF Retirement Account, and receive a stream of income through CPF LIFE. You retain ownership of your home with no monthly repayments needed. Plus, you also enjoy the flexibility to sell your property and repay anytime without any penalty fees.

Now that your financials are all sorted out, there’s just one last bit to do: making sure your loved ones are well provided for should the unexpected happen.

Like tightening a bolt or filling in gaps, these steps may take a while – but they'll also take a load off your mind.

![Image 6: CPF nomination is needed even if you have written a will. ​](https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/media/images/retirement/retirement-planning/carousel-10.jpg)

CPF nomination is needed even if you have written a will. ​

You’ll need one on top of your will. A nomination lets you decide how your savings are distributed among your loved ones. But be sure to update it if there are changes in circumstances among your nominees or yourself – such as a marriage or if there’s a new member in the family. Got questions on CPF nominations?

Plan out a will to your wishes

Having an updated will lets you plan and distribute your estate the way you see fit among your loved ones. It also avoids your estate being tied up in legal proceedings. You should consider who will receive your assets, in what proportion, as well as the person to execute your wishes.

Entrust someone to make decisions for you

To complement your retirement planning, Advance Care Plan (ACP) discussions facilitate the process of planning for one's current and future healthcare. It includes discussing one’s personal beliefs and goals for care with your loved ones and healthcare providers. In the event that you are unable to make decisions or speak for yourself, your Advance Care Plan guides your loved ones and the healthcare team to make decisions in your best interests.

Anyone can start their ACP today regardless of their age or health condition. Discussing and documenting your healthcare preferences with your loved ones and doctors can give everyone peace of mind.

With an ACP done, you should consider your other affairs.

Sometimes, due to illness you might not be able to make decisions for yourself. If that happens, leaving clear instructions for your loved ones may lessen the stress on family members in a difficult time.

Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) is a legal document which lets you ('donor') appoint one or more persons ('donee(s)') to make decisions and act on your behalf, if you lose mental capacity to make your own decisions one day. Donee(s) can be appointed to act in two broad areas: personal welfare and/or property & affairs matters.

An Advanced Medical Directive informs the doctor that you don’t want extraordinary life-saving measures if you’re unconscious or terminally-ill.

Put your assets in a trust

At the heart of a trust is peace of mind – knowing your assets are in a safe pair of hands. A Trustee can manage them to help fulfill your dreams and hopes for your loved ones, and ensure they receive their share as you've allocated. There are estate planning specialist firms in Singapore that can provide you with end-to-end estate planning services such as Precepts Trustee Ltd.

SNTC will assist caregivers in setting up a trust account and, upon their demise or incapacity, disburse monies according to a care plan developed for their beneficiaries.
